### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
#### After Cleaning the data and removing the invalid scores, Thomas High School:
- Previously ranked 7th for % Passing Math, after removing invalid data they ranked 7th. This means there was little to no affect on this percentage.
- Previously ranked 1st for % Passing Reading, after removing invalid data they ranked 3rd. This means there was a significant enough effect on this percentage to drop them by two spots in the ranking.
- Previously ranked 2nd for % Overall Passing, after removing invalid data they ranked 2nd. This means there was little to no affect on this percentage.

## Summary
#### Four noteworthy changes that took place after cleaning the data were:
- For the most part there was a small decrease in score performance for Thomas High School in all five categories.
- Their rankings against other schools decreased for everything except % Overall Passing
- Their rankings for 9th graders for math and reading scores went from 3rd and 5th respectively, to last for both due to the NaN values.
- One interesting piece of data was that their average Reading score increased by 0.05% after cleaning the data which may mean that the 9th grade students that cheated were not very good at it.
